# Youtube Skip Ads
Never been a big fan of all the ads blockers out there, but I also fed up with all the *useless* Youtube ads.
So here is a very simple chrome extension that allows you to skip the ads and jump into your video.

I provide the extension unpacked, so please follow the steps below to get it running:

#### Steps :
 * Download the files and store somewhere on your OS.
 * Open chrome and go to ```chrome://extensions```
 * Check the top right ```Developer mode```
 * Click ```Load unpacked extension```
 * Locate the directory where you downloaded ```background.js``` and ```
manifest.json```
 * You should now see a [Y] button near the chrome address bar.
 * Just click the [Y] button while on Youtube and when an ad is playing.
